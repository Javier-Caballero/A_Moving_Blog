**Code Louisville Front End Web Development Final Project**

This is a personal blog site which documents the experience of relocating to a new city. The blog contains dated entries along with photos.

*Notes: The icon at the top right of the page toggles the sorting of articles by date between newest first or oldest first. The icon at the top left opens a modal for the user to submit their email address to an email list. Once submitted, a confirmation with the name and email address is displayed.*


**Feature requirements included in this project:**

CSS Flexbox: Flexbox is used to organize content in two columns or three columns based on media queries.

CSS Animation: The avatar image on the header rotates indefinitely using CSS keyframe rotations.

CSS: nth-of-type is used to create a background color for each article. Odd nth-of-type articles are light grey while even articles are light yellow.
 
Javascript Loop: HTML content is loaded dynamically using a Javascript loop. The loop iterates through the articles and displays them in the selected sort order. Sort selector is the icon at the top right of the screen.

Javascript: Email list page opens when the mail icon at the top left is clicked. On the email list page, three variables(firstName, lastName, and email) are set by user input and then displayed on a confirmation page.
