This is a personal blog site which documents the experience of relocating to a new city. The blog contains dated entries along with photos. The entries are scrollable on smaller devices and become selectable on larger screens. Entries can be sorted from oldest to newest or newest to oldest.

Feature requirements included in this project:

CSS Flexbox: Flexbox is used to organize content in a single column, dual column, and multi-column. These changes are based on media queries.

CSS Animation: The avatar image on the header rotates indefinitely using CSS keyframe rotations.

CSS: nth-of-type is used to create a backerground color for each article. Odd nth-of-type article are light grey while even articles are light yellow.
 
Javascript Loop: HTML content is loaded dynamically using a Javascript loop which loads a json file as an object. The loop iterates through the entries and displays them in the selected sort order. Sort selector is the icon at the top right of the screen.
