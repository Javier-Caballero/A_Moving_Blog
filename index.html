            <div class="body">I lived in a predictable weather pattern, knowing what to expect when stepping out for the day. The only question about the weather was “Will it rain today?”. Now, I find myself checking the weather constantly. Giddy like a child, waiting for ice, fog, sleet, snow, wind, and rain. I woke up and started my day as usual. Checking the temperature to calculate how many layers would be required to walk the dogs this morning. I consider how cold it was during last night’s walk and subtract a few degrees. Then a few more for being Florida blooded. Next, I spot a local walking his dog, compare how many layers he has on, and decide that I need one more. Ultimately, I wear the same thing every morning but calculating the expectation makes sunrise pretty fun. I notice a sparkle on the grass, the street light is catching the morning dew at a perfect angle. I start my car and turn on the wipers to clear the windshield. The wipers stumble across and back but they do not succeed. The dew is frozen. I make quick work of it, first time using a scraper. Off to work, over the hill, into a foggy lane. Visibility is low but I get to work invigorated. The cycle continues to surprise me, another day and another first. First frost with a super moon on the side.</div>
