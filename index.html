            <div class="body">I lived in a predictable weather pattern, knowing what to expect when stepping out for the day. The only question about the weather was “Will it rain today?”. Now, I find myself checking the weather constantly. Giddy like a child, waiting for ice, fog, sleet, snow, wind, and rain. I woke up and started my day as usual. Checking the temperature to calculate how many layers would be required to walk the dogs this morning. I consider how cold it was during last night’s walk and subtract a few degrees. Then a few more for being Florida blooded. Next, I spot a local walking his dog, compare how many layers he has on, and decide that I need one more. Ultimately, I wear the same thing every morning but calculating the expectation makes sunrise pretty fun. I notice a sparkle on the grass, the street light is catching the morning dew at a perfect angle. I start my car and turn on the wipers to clear the windshield. The wipers stumble across and back but they do not succeed. The dew is frozen. I make quick work of it, first time using a scraper. Off to work, over the hill, into a foggy lane. Visibility is low but I get to work invigorated. The cycle continues to surprise me, another day and another first. First frost with a super moon on the side.</div>

            <div class="body">I was once told that St. Augustine grass had been classified as a weed and not as a grass. It didn’t surprise me at the time; although I can’t confirm it to be true. As a child, my adventures on the lawn would always end with itchy limbs. I now recognize that nature speaks and it was screaming “Get off of me!”. I am relocating to Kentucky and leaving Florida’s St. Augustine blades behind. I remember some of my first experiences with the soft grasses of the north and always thought it was like being outdoors with wall to wall carpeting. I dreamed of lying in the lawn and not getting itchy, of picnics and naps in the parks, fall leaves and winter too. Soon, I will realize those dreams.\nIt is bittersweet to leave the city that houses a lifetime of friends and family, but I feel the call of adventure and new experiences. Like a plant that beckons repotting with nutrient rich soil, I will take root in a new culture and continue to grow. I feel welcomed and invited, lost but guided, eager to learn new things and create a new reality. Life is a wonderful thing if you let it be. Upward and onward from the Sunshine State to the Bluegrass State.-Kentucky, here I come!</div>
